## cgt \- trades
This program takes a file of trade data and calculates the capital gains on the
trtades\. The trade file can be populated from the Fundsmith spreadsheet by
selecting the relevant columns and pasting them into a text file\. Note that the
output is formatted with commas between thousands so you will need to edit the
file to remove these\. Also the Fundsmith spreadsheet has the number of shares
sold as a negative value \(it is reducing the total holding\) but for tax return
purposes the value should be positive\. The Total Capital Gain figure is the one
you need to provide
